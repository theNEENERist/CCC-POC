			<h1>What We Believe</h1>
		</div>
		<ol class="mb-4"> 
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the Son of the Living God, and God in human form. We believe that the virgin-born Son of God died for our sins, was buried, rose from the dead and is coming again. We believe He is both fully God and fully man. (Philippians 2:5-7; John 14:9; John 8:58; John 1:1, 14; Colossians 2:9) </li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, the written record of His supernatural revelation of Himself to man, absolute in its authority, complete in its revelation, final in its content and without any error in its teaching. (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe in the historical creation of man. (Genesis 1:27)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe in the sanctity of life and that life begins at conception. (Psalm 139:13-16)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that all men are born with a sin nature. (Jeremiah 17:9; Romans 3:23)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe in the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman. We believe that the homosexual lifestyle or any sexual relationship outside of traditional marriage is not in God’s plan for His people. (Genesis 2:24; Jeremiah 29:6; Isaiah 62:5; Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe in the substitutionary death of Christ on the cross to atone for the sins of mankind. (Isaiah 53:3-6; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Romans 5:8)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe in the literal, bodily resurrection of Christ from the dead as prophesied. (1 Corinthians 15:1-4)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe in the literal return of Christ as promised. (John 14:1-6; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18; 2 Peter 3:3-4, 10, 13)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe in the assignment of all people to heaven or to hell at their time of death or at the time of Christ’s return. (Hebrews 9:27; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9; Revelation 20:15; 2 Corinthians 5:6-10)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that the forgiveness of sins and the gift of eternal life are promised to those who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior by repenting of their sins, confessing their faith in Him and are baptized by immersion. (John 3:16-17; Ephesians 2:8-9)</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li class="mb-3">We believe that salvation is conditional. We are saved by grace through faith in Christ at baptism for good works.</li>
				<li class="mb-3">We do not administer baptism to infants or to children who have not confessed faith in Christ, nor do we baptize by any mode other than immersion.</li>
				<li class="mb-3">We would ask any believer who has not been baptized by immersion to submit to that New Testament form before becoming a member of Calvary Christian Church. (Romans 10:9; Acts 2:38-39; Romans 6:3-4)</li>
			</ol>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that those who receive Christ in baptism also receive the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit: He marks them as the possession of God, manifests the fruit of righteousness in their character and endows them with spiritual gifts for ministry. (2 Corinthians 1:21-22; Galatians 5:22-23; 1 Corinthians 12:4-6)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that a spiritual gift is a special ability, given by the Holy Spirit to every believer, to be used to minister to others and thereby build up the Body of Christ. (1 Peter 4:10; Romans 12:6-8; 1 Corinthians 12:7-11)</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li class="mb-3">We believe that in New Testament churches which were led by Apostles or by those specially empowered by the laying on of the Apostles’ hands, miraculous gifts were manifested. (Acts 2:43; Acts 8:18; 2 Timothy 1:6)</li>
				<li class="mb-3">We believe that in New Testament churches which lacked direct apostolic leadership, non-miraculous gifts prevailed: The miraculous gifts were not present. (Acts 8:5-8, 14-17)</li>
				<li class="mb-3">While we believe that God continues to answer prayer and work miracles, today, we do not expect to see the miraculous spiritual gift manifested in the church because of the lack of apostolic leadership.</li>
				<li class="mb-3">We ask that those who seek the miraculous gifts (e.g. speaking in tongues) not practice those gifts within our worship services or promote the exercise of those gifts among our members.</li>
			</ol>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that the pattern of the New Testament was to observe the Lord’s Supper each week. (Acts 20:7)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that each believer should give a generous, intentional, regular, proportional gift of his or her income to God, through the local church, as a spiritual discipline. We believe that the tithe (one-tenth) is the standard by which Christians determine if they are giving generously. (Malachi 3:10; 1 Corinthians 16:2; 2 Corinthians 9:6-7</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that God answers prayer, occasionally in miraculous ways. We believe prayer is a spiritual discipline that should be taught and learned within the Body of Christ. (Acts 1:14; Colossians 4:2; 1 John 5:14-15)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe the Church is a body of Christ-followers who should live in community and enjoy the connection possible in the fellowship of brothers and sisters in Christ. (Acts 2:44-47)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe the “will of God” is discerned through the direct teaching of the Scriptures as well as through prayer, wise counsel, and a careful consideration of circumstances. (Proverbs 16:3; Proverbs 19:21; James 1:5; James 4:13-15; Romans 12:1-2)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that we are “Christians only,” but not the only Christians. (John 10:14-16)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that people may exercise their free will and choose to forsake their salvation and in more rare instances, God may give a person over to being irrevocably lost.</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe the Church should seek unity with all believers based upon what the Scriptures teach. (Ephesians 4:2-6)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe the local church is an autonomous body which cooperates with many Christian agencies but is regulated or dominated by none. (Ephesians 5:23b)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe the Elders are to exercise authority over the local congregation. We acknowledge only the leadership of Jesus Christ beyond the local leadership of the Elders. (Acts 20:28; Philippians 1:1; 1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9; 1 Peter 5:1-4)</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li class="mb-3">We believe the Bible teaches that men are to be the leaders in the local church. Men and women are equal in dignity and in their essence, but are different in roles concerning church leadership. (1 Timothy 2:9-15; 1 Corinthians 11:2-16; 1 Corinthians 14:33-38)</li>
			</ol>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe love is to be shown to all people as the central trait of the Christian faith. (John 13:35; 1 Peter 4:8)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe the mission of the church is to reach the spiritually lost for Christ, to teach with the goal of “forming Christ in them” and then to mobilize believers to accomplish God’s purposes in the world. (Matthew 28:18-20)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">We believe that full devotion to Jesus Christ is normal for every Christian. (Matthew 16:24-27)</li>
			<li class="mb-3">Final authority for matters of belief and conduct: This statement of faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of all that we believe. For the purposes of Calvary Christian Church's faith, doctrine, practice, policy, and discipline, our ministers and elders together are the final interpretive authority on the Bible's meaning and application.</li>
