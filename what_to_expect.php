		Visiting a church for the first time can be a little intimidating. We want you to feel welcome at CCC but never uncomfortable. We would love for you to join us for a worship service and see what we’re all about. Here’s some more information to help you if you’re visiting us. 
	</div>

	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		<strong>WHEN ARE SERVICES? </strong>
		<br/>
		Sunday service is at 10:40am. Children in kindergarten thru grade 5 are dismissed for a children's message.

		<strong>HOW SHOULD YOU DRESS FOR WORSHIP SERVICES AT CCC?</strong>
		<br/>
		We're more concerned with worshiping the Lord than with what you wear. You will find people dressed in a wide variety of styles from as casual as jeans or shorts, to as formal as suits and dresses. Whatever your age, whatever your style, there is a place for you here at CCC! 
	</div>

	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		<strong>WHAT IS THE WORSHIP SERVICE LIKE? </strong>
		<br/>
		God has created us to worship Him. Our Sunday worship services provide us an opportunity for us to worship corporately. At CCC our service is filled with a mix of traditional/contemporary music and biblical teaching. We use various methods to express our love to God and help us understand His Word better. Our service lasts around 70 minutes. 
		<br/><br/>
		In following the biblical example of the early church, we partake of the Lord’s Supper each week. Communion is available to all believers in Christ. During the service you can take the bread and the cup when it is passed and partake after prayerful meditation.

		<strong>DO YOU HAVE SPECIAL PROGRAMMING FOR MY KIDS?</strong>
		<br/>
		Our children’s ministry provides a warm, nurturing, and well-supervised experience for your child. To avoid disturbing the worship of others, we encourage you to take advantage of our staffed nursery for infants (birth to age 2) and our exciting children’s programs (age 3 to grade 6). 
	</div>

		<strong>HOW CAN I FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CHURCH?</strong>
		<br/>
		You can stop by the church office located next to the foyer of the main building if you have any questions during your visit. Don’t leave without picking up a special guest packet full of helpful information! If you have any questions before you arrive, you can call the church office at 812.246.4383.
