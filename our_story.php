	<div class="col overflow-auto">
		Calvary Christian Church is a nondenominational, Bible-believing church within the fellowship of the Restoration Movement.

		In 1985 Southern Indiana New Church Evangelism (SINCE) selected Sellersburg as the next location in which to begin a Christian Church. In early January 1986, Gary Fenner was selected to be the preaching minister of the new church. The Fenners moved to Sellersburg from Richmond, VA in April and began holding Thursday evening Bible studies in their basement at 618 Pennsylvania Avenue. There the foundations of the new church were first formed.

		On June 1, 1986 forty people attended the first Sunday worship service of the new church. There was one class for adults and three for young people. On that first day, thirteen people placed their membership with the new church. For the first 18 months, the church met in the basement of the REMC building (now Gaylor) on East Utica Street. Average attendance during that time was 35.

		After a diligent search, 9.153 acres was purchased on Norman Drive for approximately $40,000. While construction on the new building was taking place, the church met at Silver Creek High School. In March of 1989, we moved into our new building, which was built at a cost of $225,000. Fourteen months later a tornado did significant damage to the new building, but was quickly repaired. The biggest loss was over 150 trees on the church property.

	<div class="col overflow-auto">
		In 2001 the church entered into a capital gifts campaign to fund construction of a building addition. The addition, with much of the work being done by church members cost $535,000, tripled the available space and was finished in September 2003. All of this is important, but pales in comparison to the lives that have been changed through the power of the Gospel. God is good!

		Today, over 100 people make Calvary Christian Church their church home, and we hope you will join with us as we move forward in our ministry to be a 1st century church in the 21st century.
