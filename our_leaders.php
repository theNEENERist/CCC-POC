		While God and the Bible are the ultimate authority for Calvary Christian Church, there is a leadership structure to keep the day-to-day operations and ministry of the church moving correctly.
	</div>
		
	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		The leadership of Calvary has a few integral parts. First, elders. Calvary is first and foremost an elder-led church. The elders provide oversight, vision, and guidance to the corporate side of the church and most importantly the spiritual side of the church. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		Second, minister and staff: Minister Rich Hoyer teaches relevant messages that center on the Word of God. The paid staff is made up of full-time ministry staff and part-time ministry and support staff. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		At the end of the day, the CCC leadership hopes that the office work our staff completes reflects God and brings the members and attendees that much closer to the Lord.
