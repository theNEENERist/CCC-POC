		While God and the Bible are the ultimate authority for Calvary Christian Church, there is a leadership structure to keep the day-to-day operations and ministry of the church moving correctly.
	</div>
		
	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		The leadership of Calvary has a few integral parts. First, elders. Calvary is first and foremost an elder-led church. The elders provide oversight, vision, and guidance to the corporate side of the church and most importantly the spiritual side of the church. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		Second, minister and staff: Minister Kevin Beck teaches relevant messages that center on the Word of God. The paid staff is made up of full-time ministry staff and part-time ministry and support staff. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="col overflow-auto mb-4">
		At the end of the day, the CCC leadership hopes that the office work our staff completes reflects God and brings the members and attendees that much closer to the Lord.

				Kevin began his ministry with Calvary Christian Church as a part time interim Youth Minister. We liked him so much, we hired him permanently. He began his ministry with us in the fall of 2007. On March 21, 2016, CCC transitioned Kevin into our associate minister and on January 1, 2018 he became our full-time preaching minister. Kevin is a "home grown product." He graduated from our own Silver Creek High School and grew up in Memphis Christian Church, a sister church just seven miles from us. He is a 1993 graduate of Cincinnati Bible College (now Cincinnati Christian University). In twenty years of ministry, he has served congregations in the areas of youth, music, and preaching. He has also taught for several years in Christian schools, and spent almost five years as a missionary in Mozambique. He and his wife Mindy live just a few miles away in New Albany.
